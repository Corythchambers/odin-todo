# Odin Todo List

# MVP
Product spec:
# Left side Nav Container
## Button that adds a todo
Prompts a user to enter a title, description, dueDate, priority, and a way to add to a project
## Container showing "Today" "Upcoming" and "Completed" filters
Clicking Today will show all tasks that are due today
Upcoming will show all tasks for tomorrow and beyond
Completed will show all completed tasks
## Container showing a list of all the projects
Clicking a project will show all the tasks under that project

# TODO Container
## Displays a list of relevant projects and todos
If "Today", "Upcoming", or "Completed" is selected it will show a section for each project in alphabetical order and the todos that are due today under them

If a project is selected we will show all the toods that are tagged with that project name regardless of when they are due, but we won't show completed tasks


# Second iteration
Dragging tasks and projects around, maybe nested projects
